## The limitations

The purpose of this task is to test your problem-solving approach, your ability to compartmentalize development tasks, and your ability to jump in and work with minimal details. The task is to be undertaken over the course of an hour. It's ok not to finish, just try to get into as much detail as you can in that time.
