# Technical interview

## The ask

Create a responsive image-switcher/gallery that provides 2 related switchers - one for main images and one for thumbnails. See `mockup.png` in the root of the project for a reference. It should include the following:
- responsive;
- touch - the user should be able to drag both carousels back and forward;
- captions - captions should be updated from picture to picture;
- animation - the carousels should animate where applicable;

## The limitations

The purpose of this task is to test your problem-solving approach, your ability to compartmentalize development tasks, and your ability to jump in and work with minimal details. The task is to be undertaken over the course of an hour. It's ok not to finish, just try to get into as much detail as you can in that time.
