# Technical interview

## The ask

Create a responsive image-switcher/gallery, using `/mockup.png` as a reference. It should include the following:

- responsive;
- captions - captions should be updated from picture to picture;
- touch - the user should be able to drag the thumbnails back and forward;
- animation - the gallery should animate where applicable;
- accessibility - this should be keyboard-navigable (tabbable), and built with any other a11y best practices in mind;

<img src="/mockup.png" alt="Gallery reference image." />

## The limitations

The purpose of this task is to test your problem-solving approach, your ability to compartmentalize development tasks, and your ability to jump in and work with minimal details. The task is to be undertaken over the course of an hour. It's okay not to finish, just try to get into as much detail as you can in that time.
